	<p>I'm an expert in generalization. I curious about everything, and that's led to a general understanding that I enjoy using to make new connections and see the common threads to bring everyting together. </p>
	<p>When I'm not digging through various articles online, I enjoy focusing on science, news, and technology. I also have a small black dog who enjoys running away whenever possible.</p>
